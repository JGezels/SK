# Semantic Kernel Demo Code

Hi

This Repo contains some of the source code that I demo'ed at [TechoRama 2024:
"How to build your custom Copilot with Semantic Kernel"](https://techorama.be/agenda/session/building-your-own-copilots-with-generative-ai-and-the-semantic-kernel-framework/)

>Some of the code came from my fellow CSA Matteo Pagani's Git which you can find here: 
[qmatteoq/SemanticKernel-Demos (github.com)](https://github.com/qmatteoq/SemanticKernel-Demos)

If you have any questions, look me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jangezels/) 

Happy Fiddling!
